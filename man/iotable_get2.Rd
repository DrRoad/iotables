\item{geo}{A country code or a country name.  For example, "SK" or as "Slovakia".}

\item{year}{A numeric variable containing the year. Defaults to 2010, because this year has the most data.}

This function is used to filter out  a single input-output table from a database, 
for example a raw file downloaded from the Eurostat website.  It provides some 
functionality to avoid some pitfalls.
